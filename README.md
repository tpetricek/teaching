Tomas Petricek's teaching
=========================

This repository contains various teaching materials I created for the courses taught at
Charles University and University of Kent. The materials use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)
and are generally generated from Markdown using [F# Formatting](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/).
For my industry and research talks see [my Talks repository](http://github.com/tpetricek/Talks/) and for older materials
(before 2015), check out [my old Documents repository](http://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/).

Write your own tiny programming system(s)! (2025)
-------------------------------------------------

> The goal of this course is to teach how fundamental programming language techniques, algorithms and
systems work by writing their miniature versions. The course covers multiple paradigms including
functional, object-oriented, imperative and logic, as well as end-user programming environments like
spreadsheets. Examples will be given using the F# programming language, which will be briefly introduced.

For more information, see [the official course page](https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/teaching/nprg077/).

Programming Language Design (2024)
----------------------------------

> The goal of this course is to show students how to design better programming languages, developer tools,
development frameworks and libraries. The course covers rigorous methods for programming language and
library design, ranging from formal methods based on logic and programming language theory, to
human-computer interaction methods based on qualitative and quantitative user studies.

Advanced C# Programming - Labs (2024)
-------------------------------------

> In this course students will explore .NET platform's advanced programming techniques and
internals, and specialized parts of standard .NET libraries. Successful completion of the course should
give students a good knowledge of the wide range of features provided by the .NET platform, and allow
them to effectively use the gained knowledge in real-life projects developed for .NET platform.

Guest lectures (2023/2024)
--------------------------

I did guest lectures at two courses! The [Concepts in Modern Programming course](https://d3s.mff.cuni.cz/teaching/nprg014/) ([NPRG014 in SIS](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NPRG014)) shows interesting and advanced concepts of modern object-oriented programming languages and demonstrate their application together with practical exercises.
The [Functional Programming course](https://github.com/vituscze/fp) ([NAIL097 in SIS](https://is.cuni.cz/studium/predmety/index.php?do=predmet&kod=NAIL097)) covers
 theoretical foundations of functional programming and their uses, in particular in the environment of Haskell language.
