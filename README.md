Tomas Petricek's teaching
=========================

This repository contains various teaching materials I created for the courses taught at
Charles University and University of Kent. The materials use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)
and are generally generated from Markdown using [F# Formatting](https://fsprojects.github.io/FSharp.Formatting/).
For my industry and research talks see [my Talks repository](http://github.com/tpetricek/Talks/) and for older materials
(before 2015), check out [my old Documents repository](http://github.com/tpetricek/Documents/).

Write your own tiny programming system(s)! (2023)
-------------------------------------------------

The goal of this course is to teach how fundamental programming language techniques, algorithms and 
systems work by writing their miniature versions. The course covers multiple paradigms including 
functional, object-oriented, imperative and logic, as well as end-user programming environments like 
spreadsheets. Examples will be given using the F# programming language, which will be briefly introduced.

Programming language design (2022)
----------------------------------

The goal of this course is to show students how to design better programming languages, developer tools,
development frameworks and libraries. The course covers rigorous methods for programming language and
library design, ranging from formal methods based on logic and programming language theory, to
human-computer interaction methods based on qualitative and quantitative user studies.
